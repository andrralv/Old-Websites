	Joke-website developed with the intention of using Javascript vanilla code for 
	manipulating the DOM.

	It lets the user choose a character from a selection of indie artists and the
	website returns lines of their own lyrics randomly merged together in a full phrase.
	I made the sprites look like Mortal Kombat II characters cause I thought that was cool.

	Tools of the trade:

	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- JAVASCRIPT	


<h2> Rainforest Sound </h2>

	Web app that plays and loops over random recordings of rainforest ambience. 
	It has volume display and uses linux cronjobs to recommend you a different
	music album per day.

	Website is fully responsive.

	Tools of the trade:

	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- JQUERY
	- ANGULAR.JS
	- PYTHON SCRIPTING



<h2> holaGarnier </h2>

	Short project I did for architecture school. It's a PHP website that uses cookies
	and GET method to generate a trivia puzzle that one has to guess in order to unlock 
	pieces of an essay I wrote.

	The front-end is very basic but uses templating done fully in PHP. It's also responsive 
	and has download links from the server.

	Tools of the trade:

	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- PHP7

	Freelancing project. Basic website for SuperLegitimo Fanzine 2016 showcasing 
	various Costarrican music artists and their music videos.

	Will become a portfolio in two months after the video wears off.

	Tools of the trade:

	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- JQUERY
	- PERSONA CMS

I can also do wordpress and wooCommerce stuff but that's boring to put in here.
