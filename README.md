	Short project I did for architecture school. It's a PHP website that uses cookies and GET method to generate a trivia puzzle that one has to guess in order to unblock pieces of an essay I wrote.

	The front-end is very basic but uses templating done fully in PHP. It's also responsive and has download links from the server.

	Tools of the trade:

	<ul>
		<li>HTML5</li>
		<li>CSS3</li>
		<li>PHP7</li>
	</ul>
