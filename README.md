	Short project I did for architecture school. It's a PHP website that uses cookies and GET method to generate a trivia puzzle that one has to guess in order to unblock pieces of an essay I wrote.

	The front-end is very basic but uses templating done fully in PHP. It's also responsive and has download links from the server.

	- HTML5
	- CSS3
	- PHP7
